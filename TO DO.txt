1. Change downloaded filles to have 25 fps instead of 30

2. Find a way to save the video input (Create a structure for that)
NOTE# Save as json file
each video will contain a list of landmarks
Landmarks should be used in accordance to center point
example
{
{label:"Book",
 right_hand:[NULL,NULL,[{x:double,y:double,z:double},...{}]],
 left_hand:[NULL,NULL,[{x:double,y:double,z:double},...{}]],
  pose:[{},{},[{x:double,y:double,z:double},...{}]]
}
}

3. Crete code to extract from the saved data




NOTE# Probably fNr_RHand_point,FNr_Left_hand_points for CNN

[RH_points,LH_points,Pose_points]
[RH_points,LH_points,Pose_points]
[RH_points,LH_points,Pose_points]
[RH_points,LH_points,Pose_points]

number of rows = Nr Of Frames


#GET ALL DATA AND TRY WITH 200 epochs
#CHECK Precision
#Remove outliers (Videos that show different data, different words or multiple words)
#Check Without outliers.
